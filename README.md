### Sports History and Records Archives information Retrieval system

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sports History and Records Archives Chatbot! This system leverages information retrieval techniques to provide comprehensive archives of sports history, records, and memorable moments. Users can explore and relive iconic sporting events through images, video clips, and brief histories.

## Background/Motivation

The evolution of sports has been an incredible journey, especially in India. In today's growing era, sports history, records, and memorable moments hold a vital position in human society, shaping our history. However, there is currently no centralized platform or chatbot to access this wealth of information. This project aims to fill that gap by providing an efficient and optimized information retrieval system for sports events, history, records, and memorable moments

## Existing Work

Several research projects have been conducted in the field of sports information retrieval, such as:

- [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/)
- [Context-Based Information Retrieval of Athletic/Sport Management System (ASMS)](https://www.academia.edu/77319254/Context_Based_Information_Retrieval_of_AthleticSport_Management_System_ASMS_)
- [IEEE Xplore Papers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org)

While previous research has explored various machine learning techniques for implementing sports retrieval models, none have integrated machine learning for query optimization and large language models for efficient query retrieval and natural language processing. This project aims to combine the benefits of large language models and machine learning to optimize search results based on user preferences.

## Methodology

### Integrating Large Language Model for High-Performance Computing

This project utilizes a large language model (LLM) for efficient data retrieval and natural language processing. The LLM is fine-tuned using a large database built through web scraping of sports-related data available on the web.

### Leveraging Machine Learning for Query Modification

Machine learning models are employed for query modification based on user feedback. The system dynamically updates queries based on user interactions and feedback to improve search results.

### Actionable Data Insights for Machine Learning

The system generates actionable insights for machine learning by evaluating user feedback and updating query parameters accordingly.

## Usage

1. Enter your text query in the chat interface.
2. The system will internally process the query and convert it to a format suitable for the large language model.
3. The query will be sent to the fine-tuned large language model, which retrieves relevant information from the sports history and records archives.
4. Results are ranked based on similarity matching, knowledge graph analysis, user cache, and search history.
5. Users can provide direct and indirect feedback on the search results.
6. Machine learning models continuously update the query parameters based on user feedback.
7. The system retrieves updated results based on the modified query and presents them to the user.

## Evaluation Metrics Used
1. Cosine Similarity
2. BLEU Score
3. Rouge Score
4. Jaccard Similarity
